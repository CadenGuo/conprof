# README

This is copied from Go's `internal/trace` package, using `go version go1.14.2 linux/amd64` https://golang.org/pkg/internal/trace/

We can remove this if Go exposes the package, issue: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38971

writer.go didn't have a LICENSE header so I've added it manually.
