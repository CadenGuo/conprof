# conprof - Continuous Profiling

> Note this repository is very much a proof of concept, it barely compiles and only works on a very basic level.

Continuous profiling is the act of taking profiles of programs in a systematic way. Conprof is based on a lot of principles and even code of Prometheus, the service discovery mechanism and configuration works very similar to Prometheus and the general functionality is similar, as consecutive profiles of the same type and the same process behave similar to time-series, as in that they are related events of the same origin thus they are in the same series.
